# Conceptual Tests

### utils.py/runGDL.py
```
run_gdl(file_in, file_out, latitude, gui)

file_in: string. expected to be a file path pointing to a radiosonde test file.
file_out: string. expected to be a file path.
latitude: number.
gui: ctk context.

-> side effect: file at the location of file_out contains 16 parameters
 | file_in not found error
 | unable to write file_out error
 | malformatted file_in error
```

```
read_params(file_in)

file_in: string. expected to be a file path pointing to a file generated by run_gdl().

-> 16 parameters from file at file_in
 | file_in not found error
 | malformatted file error
```

```
save_params_to_file(strato_params, tropo_params, file_out)

strato_params: dict(string, number). a dictionary with name -> value.
tropo_params: dict(string, number). " " 
file_out: string. expected to be a file path.

-> side effect: text file at file_out with labeled troposphere and stratophere parameters
 | filename not found error
 | failed to write file error
```

```
save_graph_to_file(graph_objects, file_out, selected_graphs, gui)

graph_objects: dict(string, graph). a dictionary with name -> graph
file_out: string. expected to be a file path.
selected_graphs: dict(string, string). a dictionary with name -> "strato" | "tropo" | "all".
gui: ctk context.

-> side effect: pdf file at file_out with each of the selected graphs.
 | unable to write to file_out error 
```
tests for save graph probably cannot be implemented.
